Acknowledgments

I would like to extend my heartfelt gratitude to those who have helped make this app a reality.

First, I want to thank ChatGPT [Author: OPENAI] for its invaluable assistance in troubleshooting and refining my formulation process. Its support in identifying errors and recommending the most suitable models for my specific dataset was indispensable in fine-tuning the app's performance.

I also owe special thanks to Professor Jude Okolie, whose expert guidance helped identify a critical error in the setup of my dataset. Professor Okolie's insights and assistance in tweaking the code ensured the app's functionality was optimized and ready for deployment.

Thank you both for your support and dedication to helping me achieve this milestone.
