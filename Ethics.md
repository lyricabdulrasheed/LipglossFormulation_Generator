Ethics Documentation
Introduction
This document outlines the ethical considerations taken into account during the development of the Lip Gloss Machine Learning project. We have followed the DEON and Data Cad checklists to ensure responsible use of data and model development.

DEON Checklist
1. Data Collection
Ethical Sourcing: The data was collected from experimental results documented in the Excel file. All data entries were made without identifying personal information, ensuring compliance with ethical data collection standards.
2. Data Privacy
Anonymization: All data has been anonymized. Any identifiable information has been removed or masked.
Data Protection: Appropriate measures have been implemented to safeguard the dataset against unauthorized access.
3. Model Accountability
Documentation: All model decisions, inputs, and outputs are documented. A versioning system is established to keep track of changes to the model and the dataset.
4. Bias Mitigation
Bias Analysis: An initial analysis of the dataset for potential biases has been performed. Steps are in place to monitor and mitigate any biases that may arise in model predictions.
5. Transparency
Methodology Documentation: The methodology, including model selection and training procedures, is clearly documented in the project repository.
6. Stakeholder Engagement
User Communication: Stakeholders and potential users of the model have been engaged to ensure their perspectives and feedback are considered in the modelâ€™s development.
Data Cad Ethics Checklist
1. Purpose of Data
Defined Purpose: The dataset is used explicitly for improving lip gloss formulations by predicting various physical properties based on the ingredients used.
2. Data Quality
Quality Assurance: Regular checks for accuracy and relevance of the dataset have been implemented. The dataset will be updated as new experimental data becomes available.
3. Data Usage
Specified Usage: Data is used strictly for model training and prediction purposes, as outlined in the project documentation. It will not be used for any undisclosed purposes.
4. Consent and Control
User Control: Users can request the removal of their data if applicable. Since the dataset does not contain personal information, this aspect is primarily for future user-generated data.
5. Ethical Considerations
Societal Impact Assessment: Considerations regarding the societal impacts of using the model, especially concerning health and safety implications of cosmetic formulations, have been taken into account.
Conclusion
This ethics documentation serves as a commitment to responsible data use and model development practices. We will continuously evaluate and update our practices to adhere to ethical standards.
